<h4 align="justify"> 
The Nanosys research group is dedicated to the use of computational simulations as a tool for studying nanoscale systems. Among the subjects of study, our group is interested in structures such as two-dimensional materials like graphene, graphenylene, and porous graphene. The group is also ineterested in other nanostructured materials, like carbon nanotubes and fullerenes for instance. Our investigations encompass a wide range of inquiries regarding the properties of these objects.
